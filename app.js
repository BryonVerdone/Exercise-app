When a barbell is used, it may be braced across the upper trapezius muscle, which is termed a high bar squat, or held lower across the rear deltoids, termed a low bar squat.[3] The movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position.',

A full repetition consists of bending or "curling" the elbow until it is fully flexed, then slowly lowering the weight to the starting position. The torso should remain upright instead of swinging back and forth, as doing so transfers the load away from the biceps and onto other muscles, reducing the effectiveness of the exercise. ',
